Working with the unexpensive USBee AX Pro (clone) 24 MHz 8 channels logic analyzer
================================================================================

These instructions are meant for Fedora users only:

  # yum install pulseview sigrok-cli sigrok-firmware*
  # usermod -a -G lock,dialout,plugdev <user_name>

We'll need to restart or, at least, log out and log back in the user session.

We can execute now the graphical interface and test each channel! :-D

  $ pulseview

You may press the 'c' key to show or hide cursors, which can help a lot measuring
event times.
